# Amazon-Dash-Node-Twilio
Hacking Amazon Dash with ARP, Node, and Twilioâ€¦and then Giphy, IFTTT, and Mixpanel

1) Install the dependencies you'll need to use the individual packages or install them all using 
```bash npm install```

2) Get API keys for the services that you'll be using (Twilio, Mixpanel, Giphy, IFTTT).

3) Enter those API keys into the config.json file included in the repo.

4) Run the script you'd like using $``` node debug-example.js```


This is inspired by the great hack using Python and Magicforms that was posted on Medium here:
